|`[CMSCipher                ] - Unable to decrypt data`|:bomb:|PI-006374|macOS - Configuration Profile - Security & Privacy Payload - FileVault Recovery Keys cannot be viewed if Certificate expired. Observation : Filevault 2 recovery keys are displayed in the JPS as a long string with hundreds of characters starting with 'MIAGCSqGSIb3DQEHA6CAMIACAQAxgg'. Jamf Pro has a FILEVAULT2COMM certificate in the database, and it is valid for 5 years. In case it needs to be renewed we hit this issue. Fixed with JPS 10.10. Can be manually resolved by we creating a new configuration profile with Security & Privacy Payload with Enable Escrow Personal Recovery Key selected and use a reissue script (https://github.com/JAMFSupport/FileVault2_Scripts/blob/master/reissueKey.sh)|

|`[ERROR] [na-exec-876] [GetBootstrapToken ] - Computer ComputerShell [ID=<computer_id>, Name=<computer_name>] requested Bootstrap token but no token was found`|:bomb:||The device, identified by <computer_id> and/or <computer_name>, is an Apple Silicon device. There is KEXT profile being pushed to the device by Jamf Pro, but the device hasn't escrowed a bootstrap token with Jamf Pro and so cannot lower the devices boot security to install the KEXT profile. This can lead to thousands of failed MDM commands for each affected device, which impacts the DB and performance etc. The fix is to amend the prestage(s) for the instance to have an account created at setup assistant, OR if using Jamf Connect then don't create any admins via a policy until after the 1st user is created via Jamf Connect.|
